In the heat transfer vinyl project, I was tasked with creating a design that could be cut as a single colored vinyl and transferred unto a garment of my choice using the heat press. The design I choose to make was an icon representing a science fiction writing project I was currently working on called Blackstar. I brainstormed ways to transform this simple word, "Blackstar", into a striking monocolor icon.

I took inspiration from Art Deco design and the principle of negative space, and created an unique four-pointed star emblematic of Blackstar. Once I was done with the sketching process, I experimented with softening the design in Illustrator, creating soft curves in order to compliment the circular design. Ultimately I created a "Blackstar" that was both mysterious and powerful, with outbound rays striking enough to mesmerize the viewer.

Cutting the vinyl was especially easy this time, as I was already experienced with the process. The vinyl I used this time was especially thin, making the weeding process especially easy. All I had to do was pull on the vinyl using my pick, and in a single motion I was able to weed off all the vinyl I didn't need. Transferring the vinyl using the heat press was surprisingly easy as well. I transferred the icon onto a black T-Shirt that I already owed (I have a lot of blank black T-Shirts from back when I worked at Tops). The t-shirt came out looking super sick, and I was really proud of what I made.
