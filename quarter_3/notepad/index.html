			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>Notepad design was pretty fun. I've been trying to keep track of my life more recently, and this project came at an opportune time. We started the design process
				 by sketching. What was special this time was that we only had a single round of sketches, which I liked since the multi-round sketching we did earlier in 
				the year seemed redundant. Once we were done sketching, we designed the notepads in Illustrator and printed out a layout. We cut the layout using the hydraulic cutter
			and glued the pages together to make a proper notepad. The to-do notepad I made fell apart while I was glueing it, so I had to reapply the glue. Overall, I liked this project a lot.</p>
