			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p><strong>1.  What was the inspiration for your menu design?  Is this a real place or a fictional establishment?  Explain!</strong><br>
				My inspiration for this establishment is all the boba tea places that I frequent. They all have really friendly d√©cor and cute aesthetics, so I wanted to recreate that feeling.
				<br>
				<strong>2. During this class we have used the basic elements and principles of design throughout.  Identify where you used (3) Elements or Principles of Design in your work.  Use specific examples please!!</strong><br>
				I tried to establish good contrast between the dark text and the light background to improve readability. I also arranged the images and menu sections in a consistent rhythm, so that everything looks ordered. Finally, I applied the principle of unity to the various designs to keep a consistent aesthetic: for example giving every image a similar proportion and border.
				<br>
				<strong>3. Describe the changes you made between your A and B versions of the menu design.  What was the reasoning behind your changes?  Explain.  </strong><br>
				The largest difference between my A and B design was that my B design was a lot more circular. I got the idea to apply a more bubble-like "boba" theme halfway through my A design, and starting over with my B design allowed me to fully commit to that theme.
				<br>
				<strong>4. What is your favorite food offering from your restaurant?  What makes it your favorite??</strong><br>
				I like the milk tea the best. Just something about the way that milk and tea mix together makes it my favorite drink.</p>
