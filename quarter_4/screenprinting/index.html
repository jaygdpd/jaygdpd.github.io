				<p>BRAINSTORM SKETCHES <br> We started out the screenprinting process with brainstorming sketches. The sketches were done on the outline of T-Shirts to help us
				plan our designs. The requirement was for 10 sketches. I settled on the non-binary design as I liked the repeating circles of the design and 
			also want to express my gender identity on a t-shirt.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image-container flex">
				<img src="media/final.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="flex">
				<p>FINAL SKETCH <br> The final sketch is drawn to the proportions that we actually will print the design as. I made sure to draw all the geometric shapes 
				of my very geometric design as accurately as I could. The design is all black since we'll be screenprinting with a single color only. </p>

				<p>ILLUSTRATOR <br> The Illustrator design is the final iteration of the design process. This will be printed as a transparency to be screenprinted.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image-container flex">
				<img src="media/transparency.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="flex">
				<p>TRANSPARENCY<br> My transparency was printed on valuable transparency sheets that we put into the override tray. My design only took up a small portion 
				of the transparency, so I cut it down into a smaller rectangle.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image-container flex">
				<img src="media/screenprep.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="flex">
				<p>PREPPING SCREEN<br>My screen already was quite dirty and had a previous design silhouetted on it. I washed out the screen using a hose and a green spray. 
				I then cut out a portion of photo-sensitive stencil the same size as my transparency, and mounted it on the screen using water. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="image-container flex">
				<img src="media/mercury.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="flex">
				<p>MERCURY EXPOSURE UNIT<br> The mercury exposure unit imprints light through the transparency onto the stencil. This means that we can then rinse the stencil out using a high-powered hose.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="image-container flex">
				<img src="media/screen.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="flex">
				<p>RINSING OUT SCREEN<br>I rinsed out the screen's stencil using a hose and by rubbing on the stencil with my hand. Within 4 min of rinsing, the entire design was done, and all the stencil covering it had fallen off.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex">
				<p>BLOCKING OUT<br>I didn't get to this part of the process because I ran out of time. We would have applied blockout in order to prevent the ink from going anywhere besides the spaces in between the stencil.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex">
				<p>MAKING A TEST PRINT<br>A test print helps us make sure that the screen printing is done perfectly and that we don't have any problems before we put the screen onto our T-Shirts.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex">
				<p>FINAL PRINT<br>If I had gotten to this step, I would have clamped down the screen and then applied ink using an ink knife. I would have then used a squeegee and pulled it towards myself at a 45 degree angle. I then would have scraped additional ink back into the bucket. I then would have done the actual printing onto my garment.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="flex">
				<p>CLEANUP<br>If I had done this stage, I would have washed away the ink on my screen. I would have returned all materials back into their respective places.</p>
