            <strong>Swerve Shampoo - Surf on Swerve</strong>
            <br />
            <strong>1. What was the theme of your Swerve Shampoo Ad?  In a few sentences, explain!  </strong>
            <br />
            The basic theme of the ad is surfing reimagined as happening on wavy hair. Just like how surfers can glide and fly upon smooth and curving waves, Swerve shampoo allows your hair to resemble those waves - smooth and curvy.
            <br />
            <strong>2. For this assignment you were asked to include one image that was taken with our green screen in class.  What was the purpose of the green screen?</strong>
            <br />
            The purpose of the green screen is to have a blank canvas behind objects that can be easily replaced in image/video editing programs.
            <br />
            <strong>3. What item did you green screen?  How did the process of Green Screening go for you during this work?  </strong>
            <br />
            I greenscreened myself holding a shampoo botle. The process was mostly smooth: I was able to delete the green screen with one click using the magic wand tool, however I did have to do some additional work in select and mask to get rid of a green outline around myself.
            <br />
            <strong>4. What is one part of your work that you feel great about?</strong>
            <br/>
            The overall creative idea of a surfer surfing on hair occured to me as a sudden spark of inspiration, and I'm proud that I was able to think of such an absurd and eye-capturing idea.
            <br />
            <strong>5. What is one part of your work that you would consider revising or changing?  </strong>
            <br />
            If I had more time, I would have further developed the logo (which in its currently state was hastily produced after only a couple of minutes in Illustrator).
